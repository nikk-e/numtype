# Typing competition app with old phone layout.

Do not read this code. It is awful. It makes no sense whatsoever. This project was made with a very tight deadline with all the vibes. No other criteria really mattered than speed of writing (prompting :D).

## setup

npm i

## run

npm run dev

### It might work? No idea.

I have probably actually written under 20 lines of this.

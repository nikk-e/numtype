# Typing competition app with old phone layout.

Do not read this code. It is awful. It makes no sense whatsoever. This project was made with a very tight deadline as fast as possible. No other criteria really mattered than speed of writing (and usability and aesthetics a little).

## setup

npm i

## run

npm run dev

### It might work? No idea.
